## 2026-06-15 — executor (claude-sonnet-4-6)

Worked id:fca7 — created `Makefile` with `build`, `serve`, `test` targets; `make test` wired to `tests/run.sh`; full suite green.
Worked id:9868 — created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installing uv/Ruby/Node, running all three test layers; local test_ci.sh + full suite green. Actual CI run needs GitHub confirmation after push.
Friction: none.

Handoff: relay structure for toesnail — executor contract (tooling-only, theory is human-only), ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP (2 ROUTINE + 1 HARD), REVIEW_ME (3 pilot discrepancies). C1-C4.

## 2026-06-15 16:13 review — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, relay-loop)

Review of 4 commits since relay-ckpt-20260615-1613. Trust-but-verify + test-integrity audit: no test files were deleted or weakened in the window; the executor's two ROUTINE items (id:fca7 Makefile, id:9868 CI) were satisfied by ADDING impl (Makefile, .github/workflows/ci.yml) against pre-existing handoff red specs (test_make.sh, test_ci.sh, untouched) — genuine red→green, both specs run green. Verdict: both correctly closed. test_render/test_mathjax are env-blocked in the worktree (no Jekyll gems installed host-wide; npm install not run) — a host-toolchain gap, NOT a regression: the window touched zero render source. Contract pointer already v4 (current). Spec-drift: fixed ARCHITECTURE.md test_verify pin description (3✓/2✗ → 5✓). README is the site landing page, not a dev README — no Makefile/CI drift there. Reverse-handoff §5b: only new open TODO line is the id:e27e relay summary (already qualified) — no mini-handoffs. **Completed the instrument re-pin deferred by the human commit c5a6d9b (id:9135 follow-up #1):** re-derived verify/resogram_edot.py and verify/resogram_cval.py to verify the owner-ratified corrected forms (edot −4βe+ω²(2βx²+ẋy); cval exact phase-shifted e=(A²ω/2)e^{−2βt}(ω+βcos(2(Ωt+φ)−δ))), flipped both verdicts ✗→✓, added verified: attestations (edot claim=b575864e@54710d91, cval claim=18d3f7a7@a64cfdc0), extended test_verify.sh to pin edot/cval=✓ + attestation non-drift; full test_verify green (5✓/0✗, 4 attestations). Left OPEN (owner-only prose, REVIEW_ME): the cval c-narrative reconciliation. routine_open=0 (only id:3317 HARD-Lean + human-only work remain).

Review: fca7/9868 ROUTINE genuinely green (no weakened tests); re-pinned edot/cval verify instruments ✗→✓ per owner-ratified corrections (id:9135 #1); routine_open=0.

## 2026-06-15 20:51 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, fable-standin, relay-loop)

review: docs-only window (cval/.mw dependency notes id:921b→b7b1/d80d) — no code/test changes, verify instruments green (5/5+4/4), roadmap clean, 0 ROUTINE open

## 2026-06-16 07:43 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, fable-standin, relay-loop)

relay review toesnail: 7-commit window green (esol rename clean, id:3b4c mathjax fix genuine impl-only); fixed cval→esol drift in ARCHITECTURE + relay summary (id:e27e); 0 ROUTINE open, 1 HARD (3317)

## 2026-06-16 08:21 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8)

handoff: commit-hook cluster (id:d8bf → 0e63 .mw mirror, 8757 post-commit hook, d5f9 git-config; C3 red tests = 211c); 2 REVIEW_ME judgment boxes
