## 2026-06-15 — executor (claude-sonnet-4-6)

Worked id:fca7 — created `Makefile` with `build`, `serve`, `test` targets; `make test` wired to `tests/run.sh`; full suite green.
Worked id:9868 — created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installing uv/Ruby/Node, running all three test layers; local test_ci.sh + full suite green. Actual CI run needs GitHub confirmation after push.
Friction: none.

## 2026-06-15 16:13 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8)

Handoff: relay structure for toesnail — executor contract (tooling-only, theory is human-only), ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP (2 ROUTINE + 1 HARD), REVIEW_ME (3 pilot discrepancies). C1-C4.

## 2026-06-15 16:13 review — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, relay-loop)

Review of 4 commits since relay-ckpt-20260615-1613. Trust-but-verify + test-integrity audit: no test files were deleted or weakened in the window; the executor's two ROUTINE items (id:fca7 Makefile, id:9868 CI) were satisfied by ADDING impl (Makefile, .github/workflows/ci.yml) against pre-existing handoff red specs (test_make.sh, test_ci.sh, untouched) — genuine red→green, both specs run green. Verdict: both correctly closed. test_render/test_mathjax are env-blocked in the worktree (no Jekyll gems installed host-wide; npm install not run) — a host-toolchain gap, NOT a regression: the window touched zero render source. Contract pointer already v4 (current). Spec-drift: fixed ARCHITECTURE.md test_verify pin description (3✓/2✗ → 5✓). README is the site landing page, not a dev README — no Makefile/CI drift there. Reverse-handoff §5b: only new open TODO line is the id:e27e relay summary (already qualified) — no mini-handoffs. **Completed the instrument re-pin deferred by the human commit c5a6d9b (id:9135 follow-up #1):** re-derived verify/resogram_edot.py and verify/resogram_cval.py to verify the owner-ratified corrected forms (edot −4βe+ω²(2βx²+ẋy); cval exact phase-shifted e=(A²ω/2)e^{−2βt}(ω+βcos(2(Ωt+φ)−δ))), flipped both verdicts ✗→✓, added verified: attestations (edot claim=b575864e@54710d91, cval claim=18d3f7a7@a64cfdc0), extended test_verify.sh to pin edot/cval=✓ + attestation non-drift; full test_verify green (5✓/0✗, 4 attestations). Left OPEN (owner-only prose, REVIEW_ME): the cval c-narrative reconciliation. routine_open=0 (only id:3317 HARD-Lean + human-only work remain).

## 2026-06-15 16:55 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, fable-standin, relay-loop)

Review: fca7/9868 ROUTINE genuinely green (no weakened tests); re-pinned edot/cval verify instruments ✗→✓ per owner-ratified corrections (id:9135 #1); routine_open=0.

## 2026-06-15 20:51 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, fable-standin, relay-loop)

review: docs-only window (cval/.mw dependency notes id:921b→b7b1/d80d) — no code/test changes, verify instruments green (5/5+4/4), roadmap clean, 0 ROUTINE open

## 2026-06-16 07:43 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, fable-standin, relay-loop)

relay review toesnail: 7-commit window green (esol rename clean, id:3b4c mathjax fix genuine impl-only); fixed cval→esol drift in ARCHITECTURE + relay summary (id:e27e); 0 ROUTINE open, 1 HARD (3317)

## 2026-06-16 08:21 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8)

handoff: commit-hook cluster (id:d8bf → 0e63 .mw mirror, 8757 post-commit hook, d5f9 git-config; C3 red tests = 211c); 2 REVIEW_ME judgment boxes

## 2026-06-16 09:28 review — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, relay-loop)

Review of 2 commits since relay-ckpt-20260616-0821 (865a213 cross-project triad TODO, 17a964e Lean-edot /meeting). Window is ledger/meeting-note only — ZERO code/test changes. Test-integrity audit CLEAN: gaming-scan.sh empty (no DELETED_TEST/ADDED_SKIP/REMOVED_ASSERT); `git diff --stat ... -- tests/` empty. `bash tests/run.sh` FAILs are all pre-existing and not window-introduced — the two RED hook/mirror specs (id:8757/0e63, handoff-authored, awaiting executor) and the env-blocked test_render (bundler-4.0.14 friendly-error; no Jekyll gems usable in this worktree). Contract pointer already v4 (current); no doc drift. **Reverse-handoff §5b (D6/D2):** the 0827 /meeting decomposed the old single HARD Lean item into a cluster, REUSING existing TODO ids (single-id-two-views, no new ids minted). Promoted to ROADMAP: id:3317 rescoped to `[HARD — strong model] [INTENSIVE — lean-build]` (verify/ lake project pinned v4.30.0-rc2 + prove edot_first_line via `subst; ring`; toolchain CONFIRMED present so HANDBACK-if-no-toolchain moot, but first Mathlib extract ~6.6 GB → INTENSIVE serially-alone); id:5776 → [ROUTINE] (tests/test_lean.sh, SKIP-without-lake, wired into run.sh); id:1335 → [ROUTINE] (compressed multi-tier verified:sympy+lean marker on the edot HTML-comment attestation + grammar to CONVENTIONS.md — the allowed mechanical-plumbing carve-out, NO prose/math edits); id:3275 → [ROUTINE] (rigor-debt.md edot lean-attested row + SymPy-as-gate datapoint). Left DEFERRED (not executor units): id:b9bc (derivative-step debt, multi-day, gated behind 3317) and id:9d8c (CI Lean build, GATED on local-checking proving insufficient). The cross-project triad TODO items (id:6ab8 Diplomarbeit corpus, id:4159 zkm connecting-dots) are cross-PROJECT design-judgment /meeting candidates — correctly left as TODO, NOT promoted (per §5b design-judgment branch). Updated id:e27e summary line: 6 open ROUTINE. routine_open=6.

## 2026-06-16 09:36 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, fable-standin, relay-loop)

relay review toesnail: ledger-only window (2 commits, no code/test), audit clean; reverse-handoff promoted Lean edot cluster to ROADMAP (3317 HARD+INTENSIVE, 5776/1335/3275 ROUTINE), reused TODO ids; routine_open=6

## 2026-06-16 — executor (claude-sonnet-4-6)

Worked id:0e63 — created `verify/mirror/resogram_esol.mw` faithfully transcribing the `esol` energy form, sliding-average consumer `ebar`, and maintenance drive `y` from `physics/Resogram.md`; DAG staleness split correct (editing `e` stales `$e$` citation + `ebar`; `y` untouched). `tests/test_mw_mirror.sh` PASS.
Worked id:8757 — implemented `hooks/post-commit` (HARD tier only): writes `status:pending` note on owner commits; no-ops under `RELAY_SKIP=1` or `/worktrees/` git-dir; degrades gracefully if `.mw` unavailable; never calls an LLM. All 6 cases in `tests/test_verify_hook.sh` PASS.
Worked id:d5f9 — set `notes.rewriteRef=refs/notes/verify`, `notes.rewriteMode=concatenate`, `core.hooksPath=hooks` in repo git config; added `make install-hooks` target to Makefile; documented exact install commands in `CLAUDE.md`. Squash-concatenate case confirmed.
Worked id:211c — fulfilled (tests were already authored by handoff; this executor made them GREEN).
Remaining open ROUTINE: id:5776, id:1335, id:3275 — all blocked on HARD id:3317 (first Mathlib extract).
Friction: none.

## 2026-06-16 09:46 — executor (sonnet, relay-loop)

executor: verify-hook cluster green — id:0e63 .mw mirror, id:8757 post-commit hook, id:d5f9 git-config+docs, id:211c tests; all 6 hook cases + mw_mirror DAG staleness PASS; 3 ROUTINE remain (5776/1335/3275, all blocked on HARD id:3317)

## 2026-06-16 10:08 — reviewer (claude-opus-4-8, fable-standin, relay-loop)

review: doc-only window (id:d973 gtnsd archive) — no test changes, gaming-scan clean, verify/hook/mw suites green; render/mathjax env-blocked only; routine_open=3 (all gated on HARD id:3317)

## 2026-06-16 11:30 — executor (sonnet, relay-loop)

no-op: all 3 open ROUTINE items (id:5776/id:1335/id:3275) remain blocked on HARD id:3317 (first Mathlib extract, lean-build INTENSIVE)
